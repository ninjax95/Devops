git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack
cd devstack
The devstack repo contains a script that installs OpenStack and templates for configuration files.

Create a local.conf
Create a local.conf file with four passwords preset at the root of the devstack git repo.

[[local|localrc]]
ADMIN_PASSWORD=secret
DATABASE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
RABBIT_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
SERVICE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
This is the minimum required config to get started with DevStack.

 Note

There is a sample local.conf file under the samples directory in the devstack repository.

 Warning

Only use alphanumeric characters in your passwords, as some services fail to work when using special characters.

Start the install
./stack.sh
This will take 15 - 30 minutes, largely depending on the speed of your internet connection. Many git trees and packages will be installed during this process.
